Buttons are a vital part of any website. There are different kinds of interactions that we can perform on a button from hover state to being active state.

<blockquote>
  <p>Always code for accessibility when you are styling anything.</p>
</blockquote>

Letâ€™s start with this very simple button that we are going to manipulate using outline and background color.

## 1. Solid Button

<SolidButton1 children="Solid Button" />
<p class='small-text'>Please view on larger screens for better understanding and experience.</p>

As you can notice, the buttons are not too fancy. Just a subtle change in the color and the outline for two different states.

```jsx
const SolidButton = styled.button`
  background: #627D98;
  padding: 11px 49px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 10px;
  font-family: Inter, Arial;
  color: #fff;
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 15px;
  border: 4px solid #fff;
  outline: none;
  margin: 2rem auto;

  &:focus, &:hover {
      background: #334E68;
  }
  &:focus, &:active {
      background: #D9E2EC;
      border: 4px solid #627D98;
  }
`
```

### Practical usecases :
- When specifying primary action buttons.
- For showcasing critical actions.

## 2. Outlined Button

<OutlinedButton1 children="Outlined Button" />
<p class='small-text'>Please view on larger screens for better understanding and experience.</p>

Again, the buttons a subtle change in the background color on hover and border when active.

```jsx
const OutlinedButton = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  padding: 11px 49px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 10px;
  font-family: Inter, Arial;
  color: #627D98;
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 15px;
  border: 2px solid #627D98;
  outline: none;
  margin: 2rem auto;

  &:focus, &:hover {
      background: #334E68;
  }
  &:focus, &:active {
      background: #627D98;
      border: 4px solid #627D98;
  }
`
```

### Practical usecases :
- When specifying secondary action buttons.
- As a sub-action button.
