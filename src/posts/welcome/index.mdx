# Welcome blog

Hey reader,

This is Shubham Chopade. It been long I wanted to start this blog but due to "procrastination" I kept on postponingit. Anyhow, here I am writing my first blog ever üòÅ

### How it started?

I was going to fly to the US in August 2020 for pursuing a masters degree. But COVID happened and I was stuck in my hometown for about 2 months. I made a decision to continue freelancing for another year and really make something out of it. The month was April when I decided to start an Instagram page to share my insights about my daily learnings. In fact my friend was already running a successful Instagram page and that was my motivation. First 1000 followers was very difficult but then it started flowing naturally. By that time I was sure that this deserves a blog because it was difficult to share the code snippets with you guys.

### What can you expect?

Well, I will write blogs on topics which actually need it. Majorly the ones requiring live demos at different stages. You can copy the code snippets and use it in your projects.

Explore the blog and feel free to let me know any suggestions üôÇ

Wish you a great day ‚ú®
